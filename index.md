# Tigrinya NLP!
---
We are all familiar with spelling checks, speech recognition and optical character recognition (OCR) Technologies. We know how useful they are. Unfortunately they are not readily available for minority languages like Tigrinya. Many companies focus on the financial gain when supporting new language in their product. The odds are not in favor of Tigrinya in this regard. The good news is that, the majority of these preparatory products are built on top of an open source engine. And these open source technologies are customizable for any language. With a bit of creativity and hard work, Tigrinya can also be the beneficiary of these technologies. Most importantly, successful adoption of these technologies highly depends on the quality of the corpus.
