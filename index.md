# Natural Language Processing for Tigrinya
{: .fs-8 }

Improve the coverage of Tigrinya Language in the digital world.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

We are all familiar with applications like automatic translation, speech recognition, siri, optical character recognition (OCR), and other technologies.
We know how useful they are in our daily life. Unfortunately, they are not readily available for minority languages like Tigrinya.

Relying on commercial companies like Google, Microsoft for this type of service in Tigrinya might be a long wait.
Tigrinya may not have the financial gain that these companies are looking for, atleast not yet. This means Tigrinya speakers
have to work a little harder to enjoy these technologies. Our software developers, linguestic experts and translators need to do most of the
job that was normally done by companies like Google.

The good news is that the majority of these products are built on top of artificial intelligence called Deep learning neural network.
This technology does not need any change to make it work for Tigrinya, however it needs a lot of training data. In this page we try to document, what
is already done by experts in this area, with the intention that we can all harmonize our efforts to the advancement of Tigrinya Language in the digital world
