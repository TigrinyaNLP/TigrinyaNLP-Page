# Tigrinya Spelling Checker
---
[LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) is an open-source spelling and grammar checker. The tool already supports many languages.
  This page is dedicated to Tigrinya support in LanguageTool

  The LanguageTool github repository is forked in the [TigrinyaNLP repo](https://github.com/TigrinyaNLP/languagetool) and all the required Tigrinya materials are commited here.
  After we put enough rules and styles, we will request a pull to merge it to the main repository.
