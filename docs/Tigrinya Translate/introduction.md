# Tigrinya Translate using Machine learning
---
Automatic Machine Translation is one of the applications of AI (Artificial Intelligence), or more specifically Neural Network. Like any other
language, Tigrinya can also be translated from and to other languages using the same technology. What is required by native Tigrinya speakers is to train
the network with enough sample language.

In this section, we want to see 1) how we can train the network, 2) package the trained network and 3) run the final solution to do arbitrary task. This section
uses Automatic translation as a way to demonstrate, how we can use AI technology for the benefit of Tigrinya. However the same technique can be used for other
applications like Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-text, OCR or other AI based solutions. All AI based technologies can be adopted if one has the right amount of data to
train, package and run the application.
