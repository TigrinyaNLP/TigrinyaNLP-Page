# Running Tesseract
---
In this section we will discuss how to install and run tesseract using the built in language-package provided by Tesseract
## Installation
To train Tesseract we need to install [tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases).

Other application we need to install includes:
* [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) - if we are using Windows
* [Qr-box-editor](https://github.com/zdenop/qt-box-editor/downloads) - to fix the boxes generated by Tesseract, and ensure we feed the right data into it.

Tesseract comes with English as a default language. During the installation process we can add Tigrinya language which adds the tir.traineddata file into the C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tessdata folder. Note that ‘**tir**’ is language code for Tigrinya in Tesseract.
This tir.traineddata file is a language-package file that is trained to recognize Tigrinya documents. Since it is fresh installation, the file is not well trained. As a starting point we can download [tir.traineddata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/blob/master/tir.traineddata) and save the file in /usr/share/tessdata folder.

Once you put the file in the correct folder run the following command to tell Tesseract where the language definitions are:

```
export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/usr/share/tessdata
```

## Run Tesseract
Now we are ready to run OCR on Tigrinya document. The command is as follows:

```
tesseract -l [language name] [input file name] [output file name]
```

Make a one page jpg or tif formatted image containing Tigrinya text. Save it as ‘page01.tif’ and run the following command:

```
tesseract -l tir page01.tif output01
```

The outputo1 file will contain the editable text version of the scanned document.
